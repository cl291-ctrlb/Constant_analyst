Is README.md Necessary?
No, itâ€™s not mandatory, but itâ€™s highly recommended!
If you donâ€™t want to use README.md, you can:
âœ… Add another .md file (like About.md, Info.md)
âœ… Write documentation in .txt or .docx
âœ… Add comments inside your code files instead

Using README.md is beneficial because GitHub displays it automatically when someone visits your folder. ðŸš€
